## 📊 Descriptive Statistics Mini Project – Laptop Market Analysis

### 📌 Overview

This repository contains a **descriptive statistical study of laptop computers**,<br>
carried out as part of an academic mini-project. The goal of the project is to apply <br>
statistical concepts studied in class to a real-world dataset and extract meaningful insights<br>
through data analysis and interpretation.

The project was completed collaboratively with colleagues, following academic guidelines<br>
and statistical rigor.

### 🎯 Objectives

* Apply **descriptive statistics** to a real dataset
* Analyze relationships between quantitative and qualitative variables
* Study **correlations** between laptop characteristics
* Perform **linear regression** and make predictions
* Compute statistical indicators:

  * Position (mean, median, mode)
  * Dispersion (variance, standard deviation)
  * Shape (skewness, kurtosis)

---

### 📂 Dataset

* Source: Public dataset from **Kaggle** (Laptop Prices dataset)
* Size: More than **200 observations**
* Main variables analyzed:

  * RAM (GB)
  * Weight (kg)
  * Price (INR)
  * Pixel Density (PPI)
  * SSD Capacity (GB)
  * Brand
  * Processor

The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to remove missing values and inconsistencies.

### 📈 Analysis Performed

* **Descriptive analysis** of all variables
* **Correlation analysis** using Pearson correlation coefficient
* **Linear regression models** between correlated variables
* **Graphical visualizations** (histograms, scatter plots, summary charts)
* Statistical interpretation of results

All calculations were performed using **Microsoft Excel**, with formulas clearly documented.
